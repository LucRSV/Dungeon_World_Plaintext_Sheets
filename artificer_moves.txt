########## STARTING MOVES ##########


---------------
Gadget Belt
---------------

You have a Gadget Belt containing 3 Arcane Gadgets. All Gadgets are 1 weight and have a
Range tag, if appropriate. For each Gadget you own, pick one from each list:

   • Electrical, Magnetic, Cryogenic, Ectoplasmic, Steam, Pyromatic, Clockwork, Alchemic

   • Beam, Propulsion, Emitter, Field, Shielding, Defuser, Amplification, Explosion, Reversal

   • Glove, Torch, Device, Belt, Flasks, Goggles, Rod, Cannon, Boots, Golem, Trinkets, Suit

   • Piercing 2, Forceful, +2 Armor vs ___, Alternate movement (___), Elemental (___)

When you take a short break to recharge and fine-tune your Gadgets, set your Charge
to 3. This Charge is used to power your Gadgets.

When you use one of your Gadgets as a Weapon, you can spend 1-Charge to roll +INT
instead of +STR or +DEX. When you use one of your Gadgets to Volley, if you would
mark ammo, spend 1-Charge instead.

When you have less than three gadgets or want to replace one of your existing gadgets
for any reason, you can make a replacement by spending a day or so in a workshop.

---------------
Field Test (INT)
---------------

When you use one of your Gadgets to get out of a tight spot, describe what it does and
roll +INT. On a hit, it works as expected, but choose 1. On a 7-9, choose 2 instead:

   • The Gadget's effects won't last long - you'll need to hurry to take advantage of it.

   • The Gadget draws unwanted attention or puts someone in a spot.

   • The Gadget is damaged. You can repair it, but it will take some time and concentration.

   • The Gadget drains your reserves - spend 1 Charge.

---------------
Jury-Rig (INT)
---------------

When you quickly fix, repurpose, or fabricate a device on the spot, describe what you're
doing with it and roll +INT. On a 10+, it'll hold together just as long as you need it to.
On a 7-9, choose one:

   • It'll work, but not for long. You'll need to hurry to take advantage of it.

   • It works, but there's a weird quirk or complication to it.

   • It'll work, but it needs some juice. Spend 1 Charge.

---------------
Let Me See That
---------------

When you take a few moments to handle or examine something interesting, ask the
GM two of the following questions. The GM must answer truthfully.

   • What does this do?

   • Who made this?

   • What has been done most recently with this, or to this?
